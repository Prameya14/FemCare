# FemCare: Insightful Wellness üå∏

## üö® Problem Statement

The rise in gynecological diseases such as **cervical cancer**, **breast cancer**, **ovarian cancer**, and **polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)** is a significant global health challenge, especially in **India**. Despite the availability of advanced diagnostic tools, the shortage of gynecologists and limited access to healthcare services, particularly in rural areas, results in delayed diagnoses, poor treatment outcomes, and higher mortality rates.

In India:
- **1 gynecologist per 20,000 women**, with only 30,000 gynecologists serving over 600 million women.
- **Cervical cancer** accounts for over **123,000 new cases** and **77,000 deaths annually**, contributing to 30% of the global burden.
- **Breast cancer** is often diagnosed at later stages (III and IV), with 60% of Indian cases leading to higher mortality.

Rural India, home to 65% of the population, faces additional barriers:
- Lack of awareness about symptoms and risks, with **over 70% of women unaware** of warning signs.
- Limited healthcare infrastructure and access to specialists.
