## üìú Problem Statement:
The alarming rise in gynecological diseases such as cervical cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) poses a significant public health challenge globally and in India. 

- **Cervical Cancer:** 
  - 604,000 new cases and 342,000 deaths worldwide annually.
  - India contributes to 30% of the global burden, with over 123,000 new cases and 77,000 deaths each year.

- **Breast Cancer:** 
  - Leading cause of cancer incidence globally with 2.3 million new cases in 2020.
  - In India, nearly 60% of cases are diagnosed at stages III and IV, leading to higher mortality rates.

- **Ovarian Cancer:** 
  - More than 313,000 new cases worldwide in 2020.
  - In India, it constitutes 3.44% of all cancer cases with many diagnosed at advanced stages.

- **Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS):** 
  - Affects 8-13% of women globally, leading to infertility and long-term health issues.
  - In India, the prevalence ranges from 8-22%, with diagnosis and treatment delays due to socio-cultural barriers and lack of awareness.

The urgency to address these diseases through early diagnosis, efficient treatment, and increased awareness is paramount to improving women's health outcomes globally.
